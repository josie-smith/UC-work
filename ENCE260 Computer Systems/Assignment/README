This game is written to be run on the UC Fun Kit, which uses the ATMega32U2 
microcontroller. Also, it relies on many files in the ence260 library - the 
Makefile will not work as is, the folder needs to be pulled into the correct 
location within the ence260 folder structure.

forth between them. If a paddle misses the ball then the other player gets a
point. First to 11 points wins.


How to play:
